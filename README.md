## Features
* Declarative JSON-based types, inputs, and nodes.
* Custom node and input types using React components when the declarative approach is insufficient.
* Color-coded node groups, value types, and connections.
* Collapsable nodes.
* Copy and paste nodes and connections.
* Many input types supported including text input, checkboxes, button groups, and select dropdowns.
* Multiple socket shapes supported including square, circle, diamond, and diamond with a dot (similar to Blender).
* Property-as-inputs allow you to set the value directly using an input, or connect it to the output of another node.
* Built-in support for Dagre layout engine.

## Getting Started
